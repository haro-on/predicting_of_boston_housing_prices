## Project Overview:
In this project, I applied  Supervised Learning algorithms and machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I first explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. Then I analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes throgh grid search technique. This enabled me to pick the optimal model to predict a a housing prices of boston dataset.


## dataset:
This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset was collected in 1978 found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 490 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features.
### Features:

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling  
LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status  
PTRATIO: pupil-student ratio by town  
Target Variable: MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes
